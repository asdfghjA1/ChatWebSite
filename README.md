<h1>ChatWebSite</h1>
so i see ...... you want to run a chat website 
install this git repository and you will be good to go 
 <h3>BUT BEFORE YOU GO READ ALL THIS</h3>
 * you need to have node installed and thats it 

 So just run a localhost for this page and then your index.html should be up and running 
 when you will go to the website there you may find an error that messages are not going and thats because YOUR BROWSER IS PREVENTING CORS 

 you have to jsut install a cors extention from chrome extention store and get it up and running 


 so finally we are ariving at the last few steps for getting this website working


 and thats open that browser go to the local host where the index.html is running and tyoe your name there .....you will enter then open another tab and then go to the local hoat again.....and enter the name as a different person.....you will be able to see that on the forst browser thet name of the person who joined will appear and now you both are good to go...and yeah if you arer to publish thos website on "surge " it wont work cause you can only upload static sites on surge not these sites which have a small type of data base and this website is just for fun 

 if you want to learn MORE talk to me on instagram and i will teach you how to setup everything from STEP 1 to getting the website up and running ...
